TNO Quantum
===========
TNO Quantum provides generic software components aimed at facilitating the development
of quantum applications.


Datasets
===========
The datasets package is part of TNO Quantum. 
The package contains wrapper functions around some of the functionality of  ``sklearn.datasets`` for ease of use, reproducibility and consistency.


Quick install
=============
Datasets can be installed using pip as follows:

.. code-block:: console
   
   pip install tno.quantum.ml.datasets


Example
=======

Here's an example of how the ``datasets`` package can be used to load an iris dataset.

>>> from tno.quantum.ml.datasets import get_iris_dataset
>>> X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val = get_iris_dataset()
>>> print(f"{X_train.shape=}\n{y_train.shape=}\n{X_val.shape=}\n{y_val.shape=}")
X_train.shape=(112, 4)
y_train.shape=(112,)
X_val.shape=(38, 4)
y_val.shape=(38,)
